This is a browser extension that, once installed, renders LaTeX-style mathematics on
pages like GitHub.

For example [Cauchy's integral
formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula):

> Let \(U\) be an open subset of the complex plane \(\mathbb{C}\), and suppose the closed disk \(D\) defined as
> $${\displaystyle D={\bigl \{}z:|z-z_{0}|\leq r{\bigr \}}}{\displaystyle D={\bigl \{}z:|z-z_{0}|\leq r{\bigr \}}}$$
> is completely contained in \(U\). Let \(f: U\to\mathbb{C}\) be a holomorphic function,
> and let \(\gamma\) be the circle, oriented counterclockwise, forming the boundary of \(D\).
> Then for every \(a\) in the interior of \(D\),
> $${\displaystyle f(a)={\frac {1}{2\pi i}}\oint _{\gamma }{\frac {f(z)}{z-a}}\,dz.}{\displaystyle f(a)={\frac {1}{2\pi i}}\oint _{\gamma }{\frac {f(z)}{z-a}}\,dz.}$$
